<hr />

<p>CrNiCKL (pronounced "chronicle") is a database for time series written in Java 
and running on top of SQL and (soon) NoSQL systems. The base system cannot run 
by itself, it requires an implementation. 
The <a href="http://agent.ch/timeseries/crnickl/">project website</a>
provides information on available implementations. 
A typical implementation is the JDBC implementation.</p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>

<p>Starting with version 1.1.1, the distribution consists of a binary JAR with 
compiled classes and of a source JAR:</p>

<pre><code>crnickl-&lt;version&gt;.jar
crnickl-&lt;version&gt;-sources.jar
</code></pre>

<p>In the file names <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> stands of course for the actual version,
<code>1.1.1</code> for example. For earlier versions, the suffix of the source JAR 
is <code>.source</code> instead of <code>-sources</code>.    </p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>The software is built with maven; dependencies are defined in the <q>POM</q>
file, included in the binary JAR:</p>

<pre><code>/META-INF/maven/ch.agent/crnickl/pom.xml
</code></pre>

<h2>Building the software</h2>

<p>The recommended way is to use <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a> for accessing the
source and <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">maven</a> for building. The procedure 
is easy, as maven takes care of locating and downloading dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/jpvetterli/crnickl.git
$ cd crnickl
$ mvn install
</code></pre>

<p>This builds and installs the distribution JARs in your local maven
repository. They can also be found in the <code>target</code> directory.</p>

<p>When building the software by other means, the following dependencies must be
addressed:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>t2-&lt;version&gt;.jar</code> <a href="http://agent.ch/timeseries/t2/">Time2 Library</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>Versions numbers can be found in the <q>POM</q> file mentionned previously. </p>

<h2>Generating the documentation</h2>

<p>If you are using maven, you can generate the javadocs with:</p>

<pre><code>$ mvn javadoc:jar
</code></pre>

<p>The documentation is packed into a JAR located in the <code>target</code> directory
and can be browsed by pointing at the file:</p>

<pre><code>target/apidocs/index.html
</code></pre>

<h2>Browsing the source code</h2>

<p>The source is available on GitHub at 
<a href="http://github.com/jpvetterli/crnickl.git">http://github.com/jpvetterli/crnickl.git</a>.</p>
