<hr />

<p>CrNiCKL (pronounced "chronicle") is a database for time series written in Java 
and running on top of SQL and NoSQL systems. The base system cannot run 
by itself, it requires a driver. 
Currently, drivers are available for JDBC and MongoDB.</p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>

<p>The distribution consists of three archives</p>

<pre><code>crnickl-x.y.z.jar
crnickl-x.y.z-javadoc.jar
crnickl-x.y.z-sources.jar
</code></pre>

<p>with compiled classes, HTML documentation, and sources. The version number 
<code>x.y.z</code> follows the maven convention. The distribution also includes .asc 
files with detached cryptographic signatures.</p>

<h2>For Maven users</h2>

<p>The software is available from the <a 
href="http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/ch/agent/crnickl/">Maven central 
repository</a>. To use version <code>x.y.z</code>, insert the following dependency into your 
<code>pom.xml</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;ch.agent&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;crnickl&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;x.y.z&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Building the software</h2>

<p>The recommended way is to use <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a> for accessing the
source and <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">maven</a> for building. The procedure 
is easy, as maven takes care of locating and downloading dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/jpvetterli/crnickl.git
$ cd crnickl
$ mvn install
</code></pre>

<p>This builds and installs the distribution JARs in your local maven
repository. They can also be found in the <code>target</code> directory.</p>

<p>When building the software by other means, the following dependency must be
addressed:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>t2-x.y.z.jar</code> (see <a href="http://agent.ch/timeseries/t2/">Time2 Library</a>) </li>
</ul>

<p>Replace <code>x.y.z</code> with the actual version number which can be found in the 
<q>POM</q> file included in the binary JAR:</p>

<pre><code>/META-INF/maven/ch.agent/crnickl/pom.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Most often CrNiCKL is pulled as a transitive dependency by the actual CrNiCKL 
database driver chosen for an application. Drivers are available from
<a href="https://github.com/jpvetterli/">GitHub</a> and 
<a href="http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/ch/agent/">Maven</a>.</p>
