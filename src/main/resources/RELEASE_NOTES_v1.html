<h2>ABOUT VERSION NUMBERS</h2>

<p>Version numbers are in 3 parts: a major, a medium, and a minor number.
The major number is incremented very rarely, when the software is
modified in such a way that clients using it need to be recoded or even 
redesigned. The medium number is incremented when modifications break 
backward compatibility. For all other modifications, only the minor 
number is incremented.</p>

<h2>Version 1.1.1 &mdash; Project migrated to Maven</h2>

<p>This is a maintenance release which behaves exactly like the previous 
version and is plug-compatible for applications. The organization of source 
files has been modified to agree with the standard recommended by 
<a href="http://maven.apache.org">Apache Maven</a>.</p>

<p>The release consists of two JARs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>crnickl-1.1.1.jar</code> (binaries)</li>
<li><code>crnickl-1.1.1-sources.jar</code> (sources only)</li>
</ul>

<p>It was necessary to increment version numbers because the JAR checksums
are different, due to small differences related to builders. Another
change is in the name of the source JAR. The suffix has been modified and
is now <code>-sources.jar</code>. Previously it was <code>.source.jar</code>.</p>

<p>There is also a new version of the <strong>JDBC Implementation of CrNiCKL</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>crnickl-jdbc-1.1.1.jar</code> (binaries)</li>
<li><code>crnickl-jdbc-1.1.1-sources.jar</code> (sources only)</li>
</ul>

<p>Likewise, there is a new version of the <strong>CrNiCKL Demos</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>crnickl-demo-1.1.2.jar</code> (binaries)</li>
<li><code>crnickl-demo-1.1.2-sources.jar</code> (sources only)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.1.0 &mdash; All methods named delete renamed</h2>

<p>All methods named "delete" have been renamed because delete is a reserved 
word in JavaScript. Parameterless methods have been renamed "destroy".
Methods with a parameter Foo have in most cases been renamed "deleteFoo".
Version numbers of classes have been increased: from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
when defining renamed methods, and from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 when only 
referencing them.</p>

<p>The release consists of the following archives:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>crnickl-1.1.0.jar</code> (core system binaries)</li>
<li><code>crnickl-jdbc-1.1.0.jar</code> (core system + JDBC implementation binaries)</li>
<li><code>crnickl-jdbc-1.1.0.source.jar</code> (sources only)</li>
</ul>

<p>The versions are available as tags on GitHub.</p>

<h2>Version 1.0.0 &mdash; First version of CrNiCKL released</h2>

<p>CrNiCKL (pronounced <q>chronicle</q>), 
a Java database for time series, is released on the web
at <a href="http://agent.ch/timeseries/crnickl/">http://agent.ch/timeseries/crnickl/</a>. 
The release consists of the following archives:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>crnickl-1.0.0.jar</code> (core system binaries)</li>
<li><code>crnickl-jdbc-1.0.0.jar</code> (core system + JDBC implementation binaries)</li>
<li><code>crnickl-jdbc-1.0.0.source.jar</code> (sources only)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first archive (core system binaries) is for use
by systems with their own implementation of the lower database layer,
for example NoSQL implementations. The second is a ready to use
JDBC implementation packaged together with the core system. The third 
contains only sources.</p>

<p>An accompanying demo has been released.</p>

<hr />

<p><small>
Note. CrNiCKL is a relaunch under a new name of ChronoDB. 
The software is the same, except that all package names have changed.
ChronoDB will remain accessible for a while at 
<a href="http://agent.ch/timeseries/chronodb/">http://agent.ch/timeseries/chronodb/</a>
but will not be updated.
