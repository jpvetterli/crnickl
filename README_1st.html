Thank you for your interest in CrNiCKL.
<p>
CrNiCKL (pronounced <q>chronicle</q>) is a database for time series running on top of 
SQL and (soon) NoSQL systems.
<p>
There are various resources available for learning about CrNiCKL.
The first is the javadoc documentation, which can be generated 
from the source code, or which can be browsed at the 
<a href="http://agent.ch/timeseries/crnickl/doc">project website</a>.
<p>
Another resource is the demo released with source code on
the <a href="http://agent.ch/timeseries/crnickl">project website</a>.
<p>
Finally there is my <a href="http://timeseriessoftware.blogspot.com/">blog</a> where you 
will find discussions about time series software.
