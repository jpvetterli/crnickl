<h2>ABOUT VERSION NUMBERS</h2>
Version numbers are in 3 parts: a major, a medium, and a minor number.
The major number is incremented very rarely, when the software is
modified in such a way that clients using it need to be recoded or even 
redesigned. The medium number is incremented when modifications break 
backward compatibility. For all other modifications, only the minor 
number is incremented.

<h3>Version 1.0.0 &mdash; First version of CrNiCKL released</h3>
<p>
CrNiCKL (pronounced <q>chronicle</q>), 
a Java database for time series, is released on the web
at <a href="http://agent.ch/timeseries/crnickl/">http://agent.ch/timeseries/crnickl/</a>. 
The release consists of the following archives:
<ul>
<li><em>crnickl-1.0.0.jar</em> (core system binaries)
<li><em>crnickl-jdbc-1.0.0.jar</em> (core system + JDBC implementation binaries)
<li><em>crnickl-jdbc-1.0.0.source.jar</em> (sources only)
</ul>
</p>
The first archive (core system binaries) is for use
by systems with their own implementation of the lower database layer,
for example NoSQL implementations. The second is a ready to use
JDBC implementation packaged together with the core system. The third 
contains only sources.
<p>
An accompanying demo has been released.

<small>
Note. CrNiCKL is a relaunch under a new name of ChronoDB. 
The software is the same, except that all package names have changed.
ChronoDB will remain accessible for a while at 
<a href="http://agent.ch/timeseries/chronodb/">http://agent.ch/timeseries/chronodb/</a>
but will not be updated.
